{"about":"Standing at the transactional center of innovation.Acacia Research Corporation (NASDAQ: ACTG) is the industry leader in patent licensing. By partnering with patent owners, Acacia applies its deep legal and technology expertise to patent assets to unlock financial value. An intermediary in the patent market, Acacia facilitates efficiency and delivers monetary rewards to the patent owner.   With this strategy, Acacia has generated over $1,100,000,000 revenue to date, and has returned more than $691,000,000 to our patent partners. Staunch defenders of the idea.Acacia Research Corporation was founded in 1993 by Bruce Stewart. Mr. Stewart, with strong ties to the California Institute of Technology, was a serial inventor and entrepreneur who valued innovation. Mr. Stewart\u2019s vision for Acacia combined investment capital, ideas and bright people, allowing their emerging inventions to flourish. On the heels of the financial market and NASDAQ meltdown in 2000, Acacia refocused its corporate strategy concentrating exclusively on technology backed by strong patents. Under the leadership of Paul Ryan and Chip Harris, the architects of Acacia\u2019s new strategic vision, and after successfully licensing its own technologies, Acacia sought to build an independent patent licensing business, mimicking the in-house efforts of successful patent licensing companies like IBM and Qualcomm. From that origin, Acacia and our patent partners have signed more than 1200 licensing agreements with many of the world\u2019s largest companies. Consistent with its innovation heritage, Acacia has returned more than $691,000,000 to our patent partners.
