{"about":"  Founded in 2011, AccuShares Management, LLC, seeks to be an innovative, financial services firm offering exchange traded funds (ETF) shares that provide direct access to \u201Cspot\u201D indices in key alternative asset classes. AccuShares ETFs offer investors the ability to trade both Up and Down shares, enabling them to potentially take advantage of opportunity in any market.  Its patented technology and \u201Cdirect-to-index\u201D quantitative design seeks to reduce overall expenses while also attempting to both simplify tax reporting and provide investors with transparent cost of ownership and transparency in returns. Today\u2019s \u201Cnew normal\u201D market is complex \u2013 markets are increasingly interconnected and the challenges investors and traders face to both monitor and adjust their portfolios is nonstop. The constant expansion of the Exchange Traded Product marketplace has increased choice but it has not made the investor\u2019s job easier. AccuShares believes that more investment choices are better, but that new choices are best directed at reducing complexity and increasing transparency.  For any single Measuring Period in which the Fund\u2019s Underlying Index rises or falls by more than 90%, Class Value per Share will be calculated based on a rise or fall, as applicable, of 90% of the Underlying Index. The world of ETPs has no shortage of sophistication, but we believe it does have a shortage of transparency. Gain transparency in both cost of ownership and returns Gain CBOE spot index methodology exposure Access both Up and Down shares of each Fund \u2014 Seek to take advantage of opportunity in any market condition Access both Up and Down shares of each Fund \u2014 Seek to take advantage of opportunity in any market condition AccuShares has created a suite of products that are designed to target spot indices based on CBOE spot index methodologies \u2013 fund shares based on a spot without the complexities and costs of managing securities, futures or derivatives in the fund. We believe this innovative framework is designed to create a new level of transparency for exchange traded product investors. Spot S&P 500® volatility (CBOE® Volatility Index \u2013 the VIX®) Further, each AccuShares fund\u2019s return is based on an objectively derived index \u2013 not a manager\u2019s ability to replicate it. Unlike other exchange traded products, the fund will engage principally in cash distributions and potentially paired share distributions to deliver to the shareholders the economic exposure to the funds\u2019s underlying index, the CBOE Volatility Index.  Such distributions may not represent any income or gains on the fund\u2019s eligible assets and may represent a return of shareholder\u2019s capital.  Each fund will issue its shares in offsetting pairs, where one constituent of the pair is positively linked to the funds\u2019s underlying index (\u201CUp Shares\u201D) and the other constituent is negatively linked to the fund\u2019s underlying index (\u201CDown Shares\u201D).  Therefore, the fund will only issue, distribute, maintain and redeem equal quantities of Up and Down shares at all times.  Any paired shares received, as a result of Regular and Special Distributions, exactly offset each other. To maintain your original correlation to the underlying index, you may wish to sell the shares of the opposite class, subject to your broker\u2019s commissions or other charges. This may impede the ability of your investment to closely track the performance of the Underlying Index. Shares of the fund are intended for sophisticated investors, professional investors and institutional investors. AccuShares Commodities Trust I (the \"Trust\") is a Delaware statutory trust organized by AccuShares Investment Management, LLC, the Trust's sponsor (the \"Sponsor\"), into separate series (each, a \"Fund,\" and collectively, the \"Funds\"). None of the Trust or the Funds is an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or is subject to regulation under the Commodities Exchange Act or by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and investors in the Funds are not afforded protection under such laws and regulations. Each Fund's shares represent fractional undivided interests in and ownership of that Fund only. Each Fund will offer its shares on a continuous basis and be listed on the NASDAQ OMX. This material must be preceded or accompanied by a prospectus.  An investor should carefully read and consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the funds before to investing.  Click  to obtain a prospectus containing this and other information. Past performance does not guarantee future results. There are risks involved with investing, including possible loss of principal. Please see the relevant prospectus for a discussion of risks. The Funds have no operating history, and the Sponsor has no experience managing investment vehicles. Investing in the Funds is speculative and involves substantial risk and high volatility, including possible loss of entire principal. Receipt of distributions of cash or shares will reduce an investor's opportunity for gains in subsequent periods. Special Distributions (as defined in each Fund's prospectus) will alter the timing of distributions to investors and reduce an investor's opportunity for gains in subsequent periods. A Corrective Distribution (as defined in each Fund's prospectus) will eliminate an investor's opportunity for gains relating to the index tracked by a Fund if an investor fails to rebalance his\/her investments. Net Income Distributions (as defined in each Fund's prospectus) may not occur. Decreases in Class Values per Share (as defined in each Fund's prospectus) from distributions and\/or net losses may reduce Class Values per Share leading to an adverse effect on the liquidity of the market for a Fund's shares and may deplete a Fund's assets. The Funds are not intended to be used as long-term passive investment vehicles. The Funds are not appropriate for you if you do not intend to actively monitor and manage your holdings in the Funds before and immediately following each Fund distribution date. The Funds have been designed to be utilized by investors who are prepared to reassess their holding of the shares at least as frequently as each Fund distribution date. Investors in a Fund who wish to maintain a maximum exposure, a targeted absolute exposure, or a targeted relative exposure to the index tracked by such Fund over multiple distribution dates should reassess their positions following all cash, share and Net Income Distributions, and all Fund resets relating to the Share Index Factors (as defined in each Fund's prospectus). The Funds will not compound investor gains or otherwise rebalance investor positions to maximize investor exposure. The Funds are designed to make Regular Distributions of cash and in some cases shares to facilitate regular distribution of investor gains and to promote a deliberate and regular reassessment by investors of their investment in the Funds. Investors who hold shares over one or more consecutive Fund distribution dates without reassessment of their Fund share portfolio may experience decreased exposure to the index tracked by the Fund as well as a reduced opportunity for gain and loss. Investors may receive Paired Shares as a result of a distribution; thus, to maintain their investment position in relation to the underlying index, they may wish to sell shares of the opposite class and purchase additional shares of their original share class. Commodity prices and stock market price volatility measures are volatile and may cause a loss in the value of a Fund's shares. An investment in a Fund does not constitute a direct investment in the commodities or stock market price volatility options included in the Fund's index. The Funds are not insured by the FDIC; are not guaranteed bank deposits; and are subject to investment risks, including the possible loss of principal. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply. Rebalancing transactions in a Fund's shares following distributions may be subject to such commissions or other charges. Such commissions and other charges may reduce investor returns. Fund shares are not individually redeemable and will be issued and redeemed at their Class Value per Share only through certain authorized broker dealers in blocks of shares called creation units, consisting of 25,000 Up Shares and 25,000 Down Shares (each as defined in each Fund's prospectus) of a Fund. All other investors may only buy or sell a Fund's shares in the secondary market at current market prices and may incur fees or brokerage commissions on their transactions. A Fund's Up and Down Shares will trade separately.
