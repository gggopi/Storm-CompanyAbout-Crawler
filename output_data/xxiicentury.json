{"about":"      Our proprietary genetic engineering technology and plant breeding expertise allow us to regulate the level of nicotine (and other nicotinic alkaloids) in the tobacco plant. As a result of our unique technology, we are able to grow tobacco with up to 97% less nicotine than conventional tobacco \u2013 as well as plants with relatively high nicotine levels. The applications for this technology are extraordinary; in independent clinical studies, our very low nicotine (VLN) tobacco has demonstrated remarkable efficacy as a smoking cessation aid. On the other hand, for smokers who do not wish to quit, our high nicotine tobacco enables us to produce a cigarette with what we believe is the world\u2019s lowest tar-to-nicotine ratio. Protecting our technology are 128 issued patents in 96 countries plus an additional 52 pending patent applications. Goodrich Tobacco Company, LLC, Botanical Genetics, Nasco Products, LLC, and Hercules Pharmaceuticals, LLC are wholly-owned subsidiaries of 22nd Century Group.\t\t","filename":"xxiicentury","meta_data":{"description":"","keywords":""},"address":{"state":"New York","city":"Clarence","country":"United States","zipcode":"14031"},"name":"22nd Century Group, Inc. | Reducing the Harm Caused by Smoking"}
