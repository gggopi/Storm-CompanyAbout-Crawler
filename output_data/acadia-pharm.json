In addition, we have collaborative clinical-stage programs for chronic pain and glaucoma. Our vision is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and commercializing innovative therapies in the CNS area. Our history is rooted in science and strong leadership in CNS research. We have set ourselves apart by transforming our novel discoveries into important drug candidates that may make a meaningful impact on the lives of patients and the family members who care for them every day. Parkinson\u2019s disease psychosis, which includes hallucinations and delusions, is frequent and debilitating in people with Parkinson\u2019s disease. We aimed to assess safety and efficacy of pimavanserin, a selective serotonin 5-HT2A inverse agonist, in this population.","filename":"acadia-pharm","meta_data":{"keywords":"","description":"As a leader in developing and commercializing innovative therapies for central nervous system disorders we are committed to improving the lives of patients."}}
